Bootstrap Icons: For cart and other iconography.

How It Works ->
Product Listing: The app renders a list of products, each displayed in a card with a name, price, and image.
Add to Cart: When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the product is added to the cart and a brief popup notification appears.
Cart Management: Users can view all products added to their cart. They can remove products from the cart by clicking the "Remove Product" button.
Cart Visibility: Clicking the cart icon in the navigation bar toggles the visibility of the cart items.

This project is currently a basic e-commerce app with cart functionality.
You can improve it by adding payment gateway integration, user authentication, or expanding the search functionality.
Future versions of the app can also include features such as sorting, filtering, or pagination of products.

WeatherApp project

A simple, interactive weather application built with React that allows users to check current weather conditions by providing a location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data including temperature, wind speed, and weather status.

Features ->
Search weather conditions by city name.
Displays current temperature in Celsius.
Shows weather conditions such as clear sky, clouds, rain, etc.
Displays wind direction and speed.
Provides latitude and longitude of the location.
Displays country flag for the respective location.
Technologies Used
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive and modern UI design.
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data.
Installation Instructions

How It Works ->
User Input: When the user enters a location (city name) in the input field and clicks "Check Condition," the WheatherApp function is triggered.
API Request: The app uses Axios to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the provided location.
Data Fetching: Upon success, the app retrieves weather data such as temperature, wind status, and coordinates of the location.
Display Data: The app then dynamically updates the page with the fetched weather data, including:
Weather icon
Location name with country flag
Temperature (in Celsius)
Wind status and direction
Latitude and longitude of the location.

Notes ->
This is a simple weather app built for educational purposes.
The app currently fetches weather data for a specific location entered by the user and displays it in a neat, responsive UI.
You can improve the app by adding additional features such as 5-day forecasts, temperature in Fahrenheit, or even saving recent searches.
